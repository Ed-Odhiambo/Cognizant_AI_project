# Cognizant_AI_project

## Introduction:

The overall task of this project is to develop a machine learning model to predict the stock levels of products based on sales data and sensor data on an hourly basis. This will help Gala Groceries to more intelligently procure products from their suppliers and reduce waste.

The project will be completed in the following steps:

**Step 1: Data analysis**

Understanding the data and the problem statement, identifying patterns and trends in the data, asking questions to understand the problem better.

**Step 2: Data model**

Reviewing the data model diagram provided by the Data Engineering team, identifying the data needed to answer the problem statement, ensuring that the data is in a format that is compatible with the machine learning algorithm.

**Step 3: Strategic plan**

Developing a plan for how to use the data to train and evaluate a machine learning model, considering the steps of preprocessing the data, selecting a machine learning algorithm, training the model, evaluating the model performance, and tuning the model hyperparameters.

**Step 4: PowerPoint presentation**

Summarizing the choices and plan of work in a concise (ideally 1 slide) and business-friendly PowerPoint presentation, explaining the data that will be used, the machine learning algorithm that will be used, and how the model performance will be evaluated.

**Step 5: Machine learning**

Combining, transforming, and modeling the 3 datasets provided by the client in a suitable way to answer the problem statement, using the strategic plan developed in step 3 as a guide, documenting the code and tracking the experiments.

**Step 6: PowerPoint presentation**

Communicating the work and analysis in the form of a single PowerPoint slide, using business-friendly language and explaining the results in a way that the business will understand, including a brief description of the approach, the key findings of the analysis, the performance of the machine learning model, and the limitations of the work and recommendations for future work.

**Step 7: Python module**

Preparing a Python module that contains code to train a model and output the performance metrics when the file is run, making sure that the module is well-organized and easy to use, and documenting the module and providing examples of how to use it.

### **Conclusion:**

By following these steps, I have be able to develop a machine learning model that can help Gala Groceries to more intelligently procure products from their suppliers and reduce waste.
